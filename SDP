## Self Declarative Pipeline: A Palantir Foundry Perspective
This repository provides a structured, end to end overview of Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP) introduced in Spark 4.1, using reinsurance‑domain examples and explaining why SDP aligns naturally with Palantir Foundry’s data‑platform philosophy.
The intent is two fold:
- Serve as a technical reference for SDP concepts and examples
- Explain why Palantir teams are especially well‑positioned to adopt
